- 🖼️ Image is scaled and padded to fit video resolution (no crop/stretch)
- 🔍 Zoom transition animation between intro image and main video
- 🎥 All video properties (resolution, fps, pixel format, codec, bitrate) are matched to the original video
- 💾 Output is auto-saved and selectable in ComfyUI
- 🧩 Modular codebase, ready for future expansion (more nodes, helpers, and utilities)

## 🚦 Usage

1. Place this folder in your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` directory.
2. Restart ComfyUI.
3. Use the `VideoIntroImage` node in your workflow.

## 🎬 Before & After Example

**Before (Input Video):**

<video src="input/goat.mp4" controls width="320"></video>

**After (Output Video):**

<video src="input/this_is_output.mp4" controls width="320"></video>

## 📦 Requirements

- 📁 `output_video_file`: Output video file (for ComfyUI file output)

## 🛠️ Extensibility

- 🧰 All helpers are in `utils.py` for easy reuse.
- 🏗️ Node code is modular and ready for future splitting into multiple files/classes.
- 📚 Follow the structure in `Bjornulf_custom_nodes` for large-scale node collections.
